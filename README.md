This repository contains the open-source uptime monitor and status page for [SavageServices](https://status.savageservices.com), powered by [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime).

We use [Issues](https://github.com/SavageServices/status/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/SavageServices/status/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://status.savageservices.com) for the status page.
